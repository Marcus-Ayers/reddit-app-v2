Built with rails v 6.1.7, ruby version 3.1.3, and react v18

This is my first big solo project so the approach I used when going about creating this app was far from perfect. But my first priority was getting all of the routes set up and being able to access any page I would need to. And then further working on the backend login and front end styles. 

The app isn't in good enough form for mass users, but it could be good to use for you and a few friends to share certain text posts in an organized way.

Here are my initial wireframes for what I had in mind for the project. I did need to scale back slightly due to time constraints, but I plan on adding more features in the future. And I also change a few of the ways the pages are laid out either because it was easier, or I felt it just looked better.

One of the more difficult obstacles I had to overcome was getting the posts to work. There were so many little things that needed to be done and very precise ways the controllers needed to be formatted. But after a couple of hours I got it up and going and it was smooth sailing from there.
